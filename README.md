# confessions-ios-app
An open-source iOS app for Cornell students to share their honest thoughts and feelings

# Cornell Confessions Client (v2)

Cornell Confessions is an iOS app that was initially ideated for the CUAppDev 2018 Hack Challenge, where students
from CUAppDev's three courses (iOS Development, Backend Development, and Product Design) combined the skills they've
learned to develop a fully fledged app. I was the backend programmer for the project and we rolled out our first version
for the hackathon submission. Over winter break, I redeveloped the app in my attempt to learn iOS development. This is 
the product of my efforts.

 continuing.

 git clone https://github.com/lucyxubroad/confessions-ios-app.git

 After cloning the project, cd into the new directory and install dependencies with
